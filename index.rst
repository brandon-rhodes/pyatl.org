Welcome!

We are a group for people in the Atlanta area
who enjoy programming in Python.
No membership is required to participate,
we welcome both experienced programmers and absolute beginners alike!

Collected below are videos and slides from past meetings.
We have only occasionally had recording equipment available
through our history, so many meetings are not even listed here.

Our Most Recent Meeting: 2009 November

Brandon Rhodes: Less Famous Data Structures in Python
-----------------------------------------------------

* `Video of talk (blip.tv) <http://blip.tv/file/2940638>`_

 Python has lots of data structures
 besides the general-purpose tuple, list, and dictionary.
 This talk introduces more than a half-dozen more data structures
 that come built-in as part of Python's "batteries included"
 standard library,
 and outlines what they are good at
 and in what situations you might be able to make good use of them.
