Technical overview
------------------

Plone is a content management framework that works hand-in-hand and sits on top of Zope, a widely-used Open Source web application server and development system. To use Plone, you don't need to learn anything about Zope; to develop new Plone content types, a small amount of Zope knowledge is helpful, and it is covered in the `documentation <http://plone.org/documentation>`_.

Zope itself is written in Python, an easy-to-learn, widely-used and supported Open Source programming language. Python can be used to add new features to Plone, and used to understand or make changes to the way that Zope and Plone work.

By default, Plone stores its contents in Zope's built in transactional object database, the ZODB. There are products and techniques, however, to share information with other sources, such as relational databases, LDAP, filesystem files, etc.

Plone runs on Windows, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and many other platforms; double-click installers are available for Windows and Mac OS X, and RPM packages are available for Linux. For full information, see `Download <http://plone.org/download>`_.

Plone in numbers (September 2007)
---------------------------------

(All information from `Ohloh <http://www.ohloh.net/projects/70>`_)

Very large, active development team

* Over the past twelve months, 84 developers contributed new code to Plone.
* This is one of the largest open-source teams in the world, and is in the top 2% of all project teams on Ohloh, which lists most of the major open source projects in the world.
* Over the entire history of the project, 219 developers have contributed.

Mature, well-established codebase

* The first lines of source code were added to Plone in 2001. This is a relatively long time for an open source project to stay active, and can be a very good sign.
* A long source control history like this one shows that the project has enough merit to hold contributors's interest for a long time.

Increasing year-over-year development activity

* Over the last twelve months, Plone has seen a substantial increase in activity. This is a good sign that interest in this project is rising, and that the open source community has embraced this project.
